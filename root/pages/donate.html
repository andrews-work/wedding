                    Since August 2021, when the Taliban took over, Rohullah's sister and her family have been trying to evacuate Afghanistan.

                <p>
                    Masoma lives in Afghanistan with her husband and five children. She is chronically sick and cannot access medical care.
                </p><br><p>
                    She has a daughter who was at university but since the Taliban came to power she had to stop attending class because the Taliban have been attacking women catching the bus to their university.
                </p><br><p>
                    Two of her daughters who are in high school are no longer allowed to go to school because the Taliban does not allow girls above grade 6 to be educated.
                </p><br><p>
                    In order to leave Afghanistan they need money to buy passports / travel / visas.
